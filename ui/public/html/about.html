I'm a software engineer and part-time novelist. I live around San Antonio, TX but first materialized in New Hampshire.
My
hobbies include fixing stuff I'm not qualified for around the house, and building Rube Goldberg-esque modified Power
Wheels cars.<br /><br />
I'm a member of the SFWA.<br /><br />
I used to enjoy D&D-type roleplaying games, video games, films, art, culture, nightlife, reading, weightlifting, and the
internet, but then I became a father.<br /><br />
Gosh, I hate writing bio blurbs.
